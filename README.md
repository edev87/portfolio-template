## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** React, Tailwind CSS, React SparkLines, React Icons, UseState, UseEffect, Axios, CoinGeckoAPI, User Authentication, Firebase

I created a wireframe for the website to design the UI. The wireframe started off with shapes and placeholders. After creating the shapes and placeholders, I added names to the shapes to identify what components would make the React App. After naming the components I decided what content should go in each component to make my project modular and more easier to manage when handling edits and updates. After filling the components with data, I implemented Tailwind CSS for the styling and adjusted the styles accordingly to my liking.

## Optimizations

I plan to add more colors to the theme context so the user can choose from a variety of theme colors. I will also look into ways to make my site faster such as caching images, or any other data so that my site can load more efficiently. I also plan to add more features to the dashboard to give users more information about the crypto coins that are saved to their watchlist. I also want to add more features for this app and possiblly create a dashboard with more information for the suer to utilize.

## Lessons Learned:
From making this project I learned more about handling data when making API calls and utilizing the React Hooks API. I also learned how to improve my time management skills by making a detailed wireframe before coding my project which made it easier to identify the components and content that would make my react app vs trying to build an application from scratch estimating where the content should go. Making a detailed wireframe also made it easier for me to apply styles, I was able to get an idea of what styles I would re-use throughout code and which styles I would only use once.
